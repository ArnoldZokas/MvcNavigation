# MvcNavigation

## Overview
MvcNavigation is a library that simplifies menu navigation, breadcrumb navigation and xml sitemaps in ASP.NET MVC3 apps.

## Quickstart
**1. Install:** Add NuGet package [MvcNavigation](http://nuget.org/packages/mvcnavigation) to your project.

**2. Configure:** Add this code somewhere in your application start logic:

```csharp
var sitemap = new Node<HomeController>(
				c => c.Index(),	// this is your root node (probably your Home page)
					new Node<HomeController>(c => c.About()) // this is a child node
				);

NavigationConfiguration.Initialise(sitemap);
```

**3. Display:** Add `@Html.Menu()` to your view to display a menu.

## Installation
### Requirements
This library has a dependency on .NET 4.0 (due to use of dynamics) and targets ASP.NET MVC 3.

*.NET 3.5 and ASP.NET MVC 2 are not supported.*

### How to install via NuGet
The quickest way to install is via NuGet. If don't know what NuGet is, have a quick look at [NuGet Overview](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/overview).

To install MvcNavigation, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console):

```powershell
PM> Install-Package MvcNavigation
```

Alternatively, you can install this package using the [NuGet Package Manager Dialog](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/managing-nuget-packages-using-the-dialog).

### How to build locally

You need to have .NET 4.0 and Powershell 2.0 installed on you machine:

1. Pull latest source from `git://github.com/ArnoldZokas/MvcNavigation.git`
2. Go to **/build** folder and run `build-release.bat`
3. Go to **/build_output** folder to get binaries and C#/Razor views

## Advanced topics
### Caching and performance

MvcNavigation does not cache anything internally and relies on OutputCache (you do use OutputCache, don't you?).<br />
If you need fine-grained control over caching, put your menu/breadcrumb into a child action and use OutputCache.
