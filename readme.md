# MvcNavigation
## Overview
MvcNavigation is a library that simplifies menu navigation, breadcrumb navigation and xml sitemaps in ASP.NET MVC3 apps.

## Quickstart
**1. Install:** Add NuGet package [MvcNavigation](http://nuget.org/packages/mvcnavigation) to your project.

**2. Configure:** Add this code somewhere in your application start logic:

```csharp
var sitemap = new Node<HomeController>(
				c => c.Index(),	// this is your root node (most likely your Home page)
					new Node<HomeController>(c => c.About()) // this is a child node
				);

NavigationConfiguration.Initialise(sitemap);
```

**3. Display:** Add `@Html.Menu()` to your view to display a menu.

Visit [MvcNavigation sample app](mvcnavigation.apphb.com) for examples of what you can create.

## Installation
### Requirements
This library has a dependency on .NET 4.0 (due to use of dynamics) and targets ASP.NET MVC 3.

*.NET 3.5 and ASP.NET MVC 2 are not supported.*

### How to install via NuGet
The quickest way to install is via NuGet. If don't know what NuGet is, have a quick look at [NuGet Overview](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/overview).

To install MvcNavigation, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console):

```powershell
PM> Install-Package MvcNavigation
```

Alternatively, you can install this package using the [NuGet Package Manager Dialog](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/managing-nuget-packages-using-the-dialog).

### How to build locally
You need to have .NET 4.0 and Powershell 2.0 installed on you machine:

1. Pull latest source from `git://github.com/ArnoldZokas/MvcNavigation.git`
2. Go to **/build** folder and run `build-release.bat`
3. Go to **/build_output** folder to get binaries and C#/Razor views

## Basic usage
### Configuration
MvcNavigation is designed to be simple and easy to use:

* **Requires minimal configuration:** just describe your sitemap
* **Strongly-typed configuration:** no magic strings, refactor-friendly
* **Sensible defaults:** which you can override (but only if you need to)
* **Test-friendly:** you can test any part of your sitemap configuration

#### Basic configuration
Do this once in you application initialisation code:

```csharp
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
	protected void Application_Start()
	{
		// initialise MvcNavigation
		var sitemap = new Node<YourController>(
			c => c.YourAction(),	// this is your root node (most likely your Home page)
				new Node<YourController>(c => c.AnotherAction()) // this is a child node
			);
		
		NavigationConfiguration.Initialise(sitemap);
		
		// do other important stuff
	}
}
```

#### Link text
When generating menus and breadcrumbs, MvcNavigation must decide on what text should be used for links.

The algorithm is:

* Use custom text when specified, *else*
* Use [ActionNameAttribute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.actionnameattribute.aspx) name when specified, *else*
* Default to action name

To specify custom link text, configure your sitemap using a diffrent `Node<TController>` constructor:

```csharp
var sitemap = new Node<YourController>(c => c.YourAction(),	"Custom link text");
```

#### "Selected" CSS class
When generating menus and breadcrumbs, MvcNavigation will automatically add css marker class to links that match current request path.

The default CSS class is "selected".

This can be overriden using:

```csharp
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
	protected void Application_Start()
	{
		// set custom css marker class
		NavigationConfiguration.SelectedNodeCssClass = "your-css-class";
		
		// do other important stuff
	}
}
```

### Menu
`Menu()` is an HtmlHelper extension method that uses configured sitemap to generate HTML navigation.

Given configuration:

```csharp
protected void Application_Start()
{
	// initialise MvcNavigation
	var sitemap = new Node<YourController>(
		c => c.YourAction(),
			new Node<YourController>(c => c.AnotherAction())
		);
		
	NavigationConfiguration.Initialise(sitemap);
	
	// initialise routes
	var routes = RouteTable.Routes;
	routes.MapRoute("a", "", new { controller = "YourController", action = "YourAction" });
	routes.MapRoute("b", "another-action", new {controller = "YourController", action = "AnotherAction"});
}
```

Result of:

```html
@Html.Menu();
```

Will be:

```html
<ul>
	<li><a href="/">YourAction</a></li>
	<li><a href="/another-action">AnotherAction</a></li>
</ul>
```

`Menu()` can be used in child views (including nested child views).

Visit [MvcNavigation sample app](mvcnavigation.apphb.com) for live examples.

### Breadcrumb
`Breadcrumb()` is an HtmlHelper extension method that uses configured sitemap to generate HTML breadcrumb navigation.

Given configuration:

```csharp
protected void Application_Start()
{
	// initialise MvcNavigation
	var sitemap = new Node<YourController>(
		c => c.YourAction(),
			new Node<YourController>(c => c.AnotherAction())
		);
		
	NavigationConfiguration.Initialise(sitemap);
	
	// initialise routes
	var routes = RouteTable.Routes;
	routes.MapRoute("a", "", new { controller = "YourController", action = "YourAction" });
	routes.MapRoute("b", "another-action", new {controller = "YourController", action = "AnotherAction"});
}
```

Result of:

```html
@Html.Breadcrumb();
```

Will be (depending on request path of course):

```html
<a href="/">YourAction</a>
<a href="/another-action">AnotherAction</a>
```

`Breadcrumb()` can be used in child views (including nested child views).

### Caching and performance
MvcNavigation does not cache anything internally and relies on OutputCache (you do use OutputCache, don't you?).<br />
If you need fine-grained control over caching, put your menu/breadcrumb into a child action and use OutputCache.

### Extensibility
MvcNavigation is designed to be extensible:

* **Html rendering is handled by display templates:** you have full control over what HTML gets rendered
* **Html rendering is facilitated by extension methods:** you can add your own too
* **Most of the API is public/protected and non-sealed:** inherit, implement, override any logic you need

If I have locked down a useful part of the API by mistake, please let me know I and will open it up in the next release.

### Versioning
MvcNavigation is versioned in compliance with [Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org/).

## How to contribute

If you have an idea on how to make MvcNavigation better - [let me know](https://github.com/ArnoldZokas/MvcNavigation/issues).<br />
I can't promise I will build your feature, but I promise I will consider it.

### Bug fixes
I have done my best to ensure every release is bug-free.<br />

## Credits
This project was inspired by Maarten Balliauw's [MvcSiteMapProvider](https://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider).<br />
I started prototyping a new configuration API and ended up creating a whole new project. Because I am a developer.
